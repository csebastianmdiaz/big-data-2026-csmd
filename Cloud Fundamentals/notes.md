## Cloud Foundations
Key characteristics of cloud computing:
* **Agility**
* **Elasticity**
* **Costs**
* **Deployment**

## Core Concepts
- Web Service: A set of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A logically isolated virtual network where AWS resources live
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): Scalable computing capacity in the cloud
- Hypervisor:** Software that manages multiple virtual machines on a single physical computer

## Cloud Economy
Difference between consumption models:

* **OpEx (Operating Expenses):** Pay-as-you-go. You only pay for what you consume
* **CapEx (Capital Expenses):** Upfront investment dependent on a determined time frame (traditional model)

### Cost Drivers
The main factors that influence cloud costs:
1. Compute
2. Storage
3. Data Transfer:
    Inbound (Ingress): Free
    Outbound (Egress): Charged

## AWS Global Infrastructure (Taxonomy)
Hierarchy of the infrastructure:
1. Region: Physical geographic location
2. Availability Zone (AZ): Isolated locations within a Region
3. Datacenter: Physical facility housing the servers
