## Docker Concepts
Key terminology for containerization.

* **Daemon:** Background process that manages Docker objects.
* **Image:** A read-only template with instructions to create a container (includes code, runtime, libraries).
* **Dockerfile:** Text file containing the instructions to build an image.
* **Volume:** Mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
* **Network:** Allows multiple containers to communicate with each other on the same Docker host.
* **Registry:** A storage and distribution system for named Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).
